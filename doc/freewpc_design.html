<H3>Abstract:</H3>
<DIV>
This paper describes the design and development of FreeWPC, a replacement
operating system for Bally/Williams pinball machines utilizing the
Williams Pinball Controller (WPC) chip. This includes all pinballs
made by the company between 1990-1999, starting with Funhouse and
ending with Cactus Canyon.
</DIV>
<P>
FreeWPC is still a work-in-progress, with much room for improvement.
Some of the ideas expressed here are theoretically understood but
not yet implemented. Likewise, some of what is implemented in the
latest builds may not be described here at all. FreeWPC source code
is freely available for inspection and can be obtained at http://www.oddchange.com/freewpc.

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00010000000000000000">
1 The WPC Hardware</A>
</H1>

<P>
The WPC is an ASIC located on the CPU board. It is essentially a giant
address decoder that maps a bunch of peripheral devices into the address
space of the Motorola 6809 CPU. By reading/writing addresses between
$3F00 and $3FFF, the CPU is able to access the peripherals. This
includes all of the playfield switches, the solenoids, the lamps,
etc. It also includes a number of other functions that are builtin
to the ASIC directly, such as the real-time clock and a bit shifter.
Earlier generations of Williams pinballs mapped I/O using custom TTL
logic like PIAs. The WPC is a cleaner design since it uses a single
ASIC.

<P>
Also mapped into the 64KB address space are the dot matrix controller
pages. The DMD controller contains enough memory for 16 full screens
of data, and can be programmed to show any one of them at a time.
Up to 2 of the page buffers can be mapped into the 6809 address space
at $3800 and $3A00. 

<P>
RAM is located at the lowest addresses, between $0000 and $1FFF,
for a total of 8KB. A configurable portion of upper RAM can be programmed
as read-only.

<P>
The CPU board supports up to 1MB of ROM space for program code and
constant data. Because the 6809 can only address a total of 64KB at
a time, a paging mechanism is used. The upper 32KB of any ROM, regardless
of the ROM size, is mapped from $8000 to $FFFF permanently. Any
other 16KB of the ROM can be mapped from $4000 to $7FFF; a ROM page
register in the WPC is programmed to determine which page is currently
visible. Pages are numbered starting from 0 for the lowest 16KB up
to $3D for the highest, non-permanent 16KB page. If the ROM size
is less than 1MB, then pages are renumbered so that the highest page
remains $3D.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00011000000000000000">
1.1 Initialization</A>
</H2>

<P>
Control begins by branching to RESET routine; the RESET vector at
the top of memory must be programmed with this address so the 6809
can find it when it powers up. 

<P>
It is best not to make any assumptions about the values of I/O registers
immediately after booting. Therefore, one of the first things that
normally happens in embedded systems is to program all of the registers
with sane values.

<P>
It is unknown what the WPC bank switching register starts at, so to
be safe, make sure the reset routine resides in the non-paged portion
of the address space ($8000 to $FFFF).

<P>
The 6809 has a direct page register, DP, which controls which 256
bytes of RAM are addressed by the 1-byte form of effective address.
FreeWPC places commonly used variables from $0000 to $00FF so DP
should be programmed to zero before accessing any RAM.

<P>
During initialization, keep all interrupts disabled until all data
structures are setup that need to be in place for the interrupt handlers
to work properly.

<P>
Each module of the kernel is initialized in turn, starting with the
hardware related modules and moving up to the software-only modules.
Once init is complete, the kernel can enable interrupts and then jump
into the task scheduler. The <I>first task</I> is started before
doing so, to ensure that there is some work to be done. The first
task takes care of switch scheduling, which drives all of the other
functions, and starts up the initial attract mode.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00020000000000000000">
2 General Requirements</A>
</H1>

<P>
There are numerous ways to approach the construction of an embedded
system. Here are the some of the general requirements that have influenced
the design of FreeWPC:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>It must provide realtime capabilities. People don't expect machines
to miss switch closures, in the way that Windows users sometime experience
moments where the system &#34;freezes&#34; when it becomes
busy. Also, some operations require extremely fine timing control,
like the pulsing of a solenoid, which needs millisecond-level control.
(Modern desktop operating systems typically can only provide 10ms
granularity, by comparison.)
</LI>
<LI>It needs multitasking. Machines have to manage lots of physical devices
at the same time. Switches need to be polled at the same time as the
sounds, lights, and display are updated. At a higher layer, game rules
often involve multiple &#34;modes&#34; running at the same
time. At the same time, interprocess communication (IPC) features
are generally not required, as most of the different tasks are independent.
</LI>
<LI>It must cope with a small amount of RAM. 8KB is not a lot of room
to work with. Keeping dynamic data structures as small as possible
is a challenge.
</LI>
<LI>It should be written in C as much as possible. This is a requirement
I imposed on the system myself. Software engineers from Williams have
repeatedly indicated that they wrote the games directly in assembly
language. In some ways this is better, since the developer has completely
control of what the CPU is doing. Good compilers were not available
for the 6809 back in 1990, so assembly was the only available choice
when WPC was first developed. Today, there is a gcc port for the 6809
which is sufficient for producing decent performing code. Using C
also allows more people to get involved in the project and understand
what is going on.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00030000000000000000">
3 Scheduling</A>
</H1>

<P>
FreeWPC contains a small microkernel which supports nonpreemptive,
first-come first-serve (FCFS) multitasking and multigranular soft
realtime processes. That is:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>FreeWPC is a multitasking system, which provides the illusion of multiple
threads running in parallel.
</LI>
<LI>There are two classes of tasks, ordinary and realtime. 
</LI>
<LI>The realtime tasks have priority and are scheduled at compile-time
to one of several periods (e.g. every 1ms, every 8ms, etc.) Realtime
tasks cannot sleep. They are triggered to run based on the IRQ interrupt,
which fires about once per 1ms.
</LI>
<LI>The FCFS tasks take whatever CPU time is remaining. Each task will
continue to run until it explicitly gives up control to the next FCFS
task (that's the nonpreemptive part). These tasks can sleep. They
can only be interrupted by the periodic realtime tasks.
</LI>
</UL>
This design is simple enough for what we need. There is no explicit
support for multitask communications like queues or semaphores. In
most cases, locking support is not needed: the only time would be
when you need to synchronize between a realtime and an FCFS task.
The solution is for the FCFS task to disable the IRQ interrupt around
the critical section, since that keeps the realtime tasks from getting
scheduled. These critical sections need to be kept extremely small,
though.

<P>
The WPC chip drives the IRQ line of the 6809 to generate an interrupt
once every 976 microseconds... The timing of the IRQ is fairly accurate
as it is derived from the 32Khz oscillator on the CPU board. Thus,
the IRQ is used as the main timing source for the kernel.

<P>
Realtime functions are called directly from the IRQ vector. FCFS tasks
which are sleeping have their &#34;time-until-ready-to-run&#34;
counters updated based on the number of IRQs that have happened.

<P>
It is possible to compute the percentage of time spent running at
the IRQ level, since the functions are mostly fixed. (There will always
be some variations due to whether or not some conditional branches
are taken.) The more efficient the realtime functions, the more time
available for other tasks.

<P>
At 2MHz, the IRQ is triggered about once every 1952 CPU cycles, which
is not much, especially considering that 6809 instructions often require
3 or 4 cycles to execute. There is a fine balance to be found here.
Realtime functions need to run every so often, but not more often
than that. Polling more frequently than necessary is simply a waste
of time, for example.

<P>
Realtime tasks are scheduled in terms of &#34;IRQ ticks&#34;.
If a function needs to run every 8ms, and the IRQ occurs once every
1ms, then the function should only be called once out of every 8 IRQs.
However, the functions should be scheduled in such a way that the
total duration of realtime calls during a single IRQ does not exceed
the time between IRQs; when this happens, the realtime guarantee has
failed.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00040000000000000000">
4 Modularity</A>
</H1>

<P>
The system is designed to be as modular as possible. Each hardware
component, such as switches, lamps, or solenoids, is managed by a
different module in the kernel, which normally is implemented in a
single .c file in the kernel directory. The kernel provides standard
APIs for accessing the hardware. &#34;User code&#34; should
never directly write to a WPC hardware register. Most hardware modules
provide a periodic realtime function that does the very low-level
I/O, e.g. polling switches or redrawing the lamp matrix. FCFS code
rarely will touch the hardware directly; instead, it will either queue
the request (if it is to drive an output), or read from an internal
buffer (if it is a read request - which will retrieve the last value
polled by the realtime function).

<P>
There is also the modularity between the kernel and the user code.
Each machine can define special &#34;hook&#34; functions
that need to be invoked when certain events occur. These are implemented
as callback functions. This allows the kernel to be &#34;extended&#34;
to suit the needs of a particular machine. Also, there are a number
of constants which are machine-specific. Each machine has a &#34;config.h&#34;
file that contains all of those values. As much as possible, algorithms
which are common to nearly all machines are put into the shared kernel,
with allowances for machines to provide extensions or overrides.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00050000000000000000">
5 Physical Inputs and Outputs</A>
</H1>

<P>
Aside from the multitasking, the kernel is mostly concerned with the
management of hardware resources: input and output devices. Here is
where the differences between an emulator like PinMAME and actual
hardware vastly differ. What has been implemented so far works pretty
well in the emulations, though.

<P>
The major input devices are, of course, the various switches and buttons.
There's also the DIP switches on the CPU board, the real time clock,
and the AC zero-cross detection circuit. Switches are the easiest
to describe because they work in theory in the simplest possible way.
Every switch is just a binary input, either 1 (active) or 0 (inactive). 

<P>
Of course, it's much more complicated than that. First and foremost
is the need for debouncing with the mechanical (non-opto) type switches,
in which a significant amount of vibration occurs upon closure, causing
the CPU to see tens of closures instead of one. Debounce logic takes
the raw switch signal and filters it to produce a smoother, more binary
type signal. Transitions only occur if they hold their new state for
a certain period of time (which may be dependent on the type of switch
and its location on the playfield).

<P>
Output devices like lamps and solenoids are just the opposite: they
are binary outputs, which in theory are logically on (1) or off (0).
The exact opposite of debouncing needs to be performed here, though:
to prevent fatigue of a coil, a logical &#34;1&#34; signal
needs to be &#34;bounced&#34; so that it is really only
a &#34;1&#34; every so often, and &#34;0&#34;
otherwise. This is called &#34;duty cycling&#34;. The algorithm
could be different depending on the type of coil or duration of the
pulse.

<P>
Switches and lamps have an additional complicating factor in WPC:
they can't all be addressed at the same time. Instead, they are arranged
into an 8x8 matrix. At any given time, only one column (8 switches
or 8 lamps) is addressable for reading/writing. Another register must
first be programmed with the column value to determine which of the
8 columns it will be. For lamps, this adds inherent duty cycling as
no more than 8 of the lamps will ever be on at a time. For switches,
there is the complication of optos, which are normally closed and
open when they become active. Software must use &#34;backwards
logic&#34; on these.

<P>
Some hardware registers are write-only, which requires that software
remember the last value written if it will ever need to be &#34;read&#34;.
The read then comes from the cached value rather than touching the
hardware.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00060000000000000000">
6 Logical Inputs = Events</A>
</H1>

<P>
Switch inputs and timers comprise the physical inputs of the system.
It is useful to generalize the notion of an input to software constructs
as well. The generic term used here is an event. An event is associated
with two entities: that which creates the event, and that which receives
or handles the event.

<P>
For example, when a ball enters an eject hole, the switch closure
creates an event that reflects the ball entering the eject. Multiple
event receivers may be interested in processing this event: there
may be multiple game modes that need to respond to the event, the
ball tracking system will want to know that the ball should be ejected,
etc.

<P>
The key observation used throughout FreeWPC is that static events
can be modelled as simple function calls at compile time. Creating
an event is equivalent to calling a unique function associated with
that event. This function's sole job is to inform all event receivers
that the event occurred, again by direct function calls. Each receiver
is a function that is called by the event generator. In most cases,
for well-known events, no storage need be maintained to model events
at all.

<P>
When a FreeWPC program is compiled, the source code is scanned to
see what events are created, and which events are received. The event
generation functions can then automatically be created.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00070000000000000000">
7 Logical Outputs = Effects</A>
</H1>

<P>
At a layer above the physical hardware, management must be provided
for output devices when there are multiple tasks wanting to access
them. The dot matrix, lamps, solenoids, and music playing can all
be controlled fairly easily, but if multiple tasks want to use them
at the same time, what do you do?

<P>
The solution implemented in FreeWPC involves hardcoded priorities.
When a task wants to use a resource, it first tries to allocate that
resource, passing a priority value. The allocation/free approach is
very similar to the way that files or other devices are opened/closed
on traditional UNIX systems. Only the task with the highest priority
is allowed to use the resource. This usage is preemptive, unlike task
scheduling: when a higher priority task takes over control over a
resource, the lower priority task must stop using it immediately.
Likewise, when the higher priority task is done, control should be
returned to the lower priority task.

<P>
This approach is implemented by a data structure called a priority
queue. Priority queueing is often used in realtime operating systems
for task scheduling, but it is slightly different here. Our FCFS tasks
have no concept of priority; they all run equally first-come, first-serve.
We want to partition them into different sets based on the resources
that they need. All tasks using the display would be in one set; all
tasks requiring the lamps would be in another set. Tasks in different
sets are disjoint and can be scheduled independently. However, within
a single set, only the single task with the highest priority gets
to use that resource.

<P>
This is how I think it should work in theory. There are additional
complications. What about tasks that require multiple resources, like
a jackpot animation that wants to drive the display, lamps, and make
some explosion sounds? These are three distinct resources, and not
all of them may be available at the time of the effect. In the current
FreeWPC approach, it would require three separate tasks to do all
of these things. They could all have different priorities even. So
if the lamps are busy, at least the other two things can happen. For
something like a jackpot animation, this probably indicates a flaw
in the priority assignments, but for some effects, this might make
sense.

<P>
Also, consider the granularity of the resource. In the simplest approach,
all of the lamps could be treated as a single resource, so you get
all or none of them. But you could break it down further and manage
each lamp separately, so that a lamp effect might run but only be
able to update some of the lamps. The net effect is that you could
have multiple tasks operating on different &#34;parts&#34;
of a resource at the same time. To implement the priority queueing
properly, a task that wants to implement some part of an effect needs
to be standalone from any other processing. That way, that particular
task can be stopped/started by the kernel's resource management routines
as priorities change. Only the tasks that are actively controlling
the resource will be running. The kernel simply remembers all of the
tasks that have been queued up which can't run now.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00071000000000000000">
7.1 Display Effects</A>
</H2>

<P>
The dot matrix display is treated as a single resource that is owned
by only one ``display effect'' at a time. Multiple display effects
(referred to as deffs in the source code) may be started, but only
the one with the highest priority is allowed to use the display.
